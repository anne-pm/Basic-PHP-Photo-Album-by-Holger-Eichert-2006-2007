<p>Installation:</p>
<p>1.) Place your photos into the images directory. Photos will be displayed in alphabetical order.<br>
 2.) Rename the &quot;basic-php-photo-album&quot; folder to anything you wish. – Example: paris-photo-album<br>
3.) Upload the renamed folder and all of its contents to your server.
 – If your domain is www<span>.</span>mysite<span>.</span>com, your album can be viewed at http<span>:</span>//www<span>.</span>mysite<span>.</span>com/paris-photo-album/<br><br>
That&#39;s it! Make multiple albums by repeating the above 3 steps.
